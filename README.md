# Automatic-River-Encroachment-Detection

## Problem Statement

River encroachment is a threatening problem that has been going on for a few years now. Bangladesh Govt. has been relentlessly working to free rivers from encroachment after ensuring their navigability by dredging them round the year. BIWTA has removed a total of 18,025 illegal structures from riverbanks between 2010 and 2019 and reclaimed 738 acres of riverbanks from encroachments in Dhaka and Narayanganj river port areas. The National River Conservation Commission says 50 percent of the rivers have been freed from the clutch of grabbers, but the rate is only 7 percent in Barishal, the lawyer said. Bangladesh has around 800 rivers. The State Minister recently said over 65,000 grabbers have encroached on the rivers.

## Project Goals :

• Collect data from opensource satellite images of specific rivers of Bangladesh, such as Buriganga, Meghna, etc, and extract necessary information with remote sensing analysis.
• Process the data following a systematic methodology and do exploratory data analysis of illegally occupied river banks.
• Develop an automatic encroachment detection for certain rivers and deliver geolocations of them.
• Outline an AI-driven solution to improve the cautioning system for Bangladesh.


## Locations Choosen : 

We had choosen "Keraniganj", "Kamrangirchar" and "Bosilsaa" as our regions of interest, which is onto the river banks of "Buriganga" river. Its located in the city premises of Dhaka
